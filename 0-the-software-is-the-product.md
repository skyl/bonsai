# The Software is the Product

Your software is your product. No amount of clicking around in some wiki
software
or project management web-app will result in an improvement to
_your_ software product. For your software to improve and grow, you must make
changes to your software. Processes should only be implemented which
facilitate change and help make your software better.
If a process does not contribute to making your software better,
eliminate it.

## All Process Must Facilitate Change

Hopefully your software is made by committing changes in your version
control system. If you're not familiar with version control, this will
be one of the first things you'll want to study as Version Control Systems
(VCSs)
are now always at the heart of software change. This is the first place
where you will want to implement some process for delivering change -
your version control system. If you're working alone, maybe you can just
push changes directly to your main branch and have a third-party service
automatically deploy the changes for you.
This could be a beautiful, simple process that allows you to
change and grow your software product. Work towards being able to change your
software with a single, simple command.
Perhaps you have a ton of contributors
with varying levels of maturity. In this case you will probably need to
implement more checks and tests before allowing contributors to commit their
changes to your software. Processes around ensuring that your changes land
well in production are at the heart of your process. If any one-line change
to your software requires a lot of manual steps to test an deploy, your
software will stagnate. Optimize for the one-line change. How fast can you
ensure that this change doesn't cause a regression and send it to production?

## Eliminate Processes that Don't Facilitate Change

Don't create disincentives to making improvements. If for every improvement
to the software I make, I need to take a punch in the face, I'm going to
make a lot fewer improvements. This is perhaps not a realistic example.
But, most software teams, if they think about it, can think of
costly and annoying processes that make them not want to contribute
improvements. Maybe I would need to run a bunch of tests manually or check with
someone else to do some manual action, maybe a few emails will need to be sent.
Maybe you will have to hand-write some release notes. Maybe you will need to
register your change in some clunky, old system that you hate. So, rather
than improving the software, you leave it how it is because you detest the
process around changing the software. Make changing the software cheap
and easy.
Eliminate processes that don't make changing the software easier.

## But, We Have to Punch Ourselves in the Face

I know. In _your_ organization, they have this medieval torture device
where people have to be put on the rack for 30 minutes for any improvement
they want to make to the software. You may not have any choice in that.
You may have to submit to the torture, at least in the short term. But,
this book is mostly about what you can control and how you can adapt to your
organization's context.
Don't impose torture on your own team that you are not forced to impose on
them. Eliminate drudgery and toil so your team has more time for inspired
productivity.
