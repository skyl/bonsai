# Avoid Context Switching

[Context switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) is a term
in multitasking computer operating systems where the context of a thread
or process can be stored and saved so the work can be resumed later.
This way several processes can utilize the same CPU.

Context switching can be a

 and people. If you switch too frequently
between too many tasks, you may end up working very hard while delivering

Work on one thing and finish it. Or, at least try to come to a stopping point
that is an improvement over the current version and deliver that improvement
before switching to a different task.

One process that many people developing software utilize to limit context
switching is a

In this model, each engineer should ideally have exactly 1 item in progress
at a given time and they see that to completion before picking up the next
most important task.
