# The Software is the Product

Your software is your product. No amount of clicking around in some wiki
or project management web-app will result in an improvement to
_your_ software product. For your software to improve and grow, you must make
changes to your software. All external process should only happen
in service of making your software better.
If a process does not contribute to making your software better,
eliminate it.
