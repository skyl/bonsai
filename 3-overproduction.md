# Eliminate Overproduction

The top source of waste is overproduction. Overproduction of software,
overproduction of backlog, overproduction of features, overproduction of
meetings. Even ostensibly good things like documentation and tests can be
overproduced. Produce just enough, just-in-time. Produce enough tests
to make sure that you can change with confidence and that the software
behaves as expected. Produce enough documentation to make your users happy.

If you produce backlog that no one will ever look at,
you have produced nothing.
Some overproduction can cause maintenance burden over a long period of time.
A feature that seems easy at the time can cause a long-lasting drag
on the team to support and maintain.
