# Inspiration in the Key

As much as we try to turn software development into a science, the truth
is that it is a creative pursuit driven by people. Your people can be 100 times
more productive when they are motivated and inspired than if they are
depressed, angry, resentful, bitter or mopey. Your process must help get people
into the flow of inspiration and you must do everything you can to prevent
processes and practices that kill joy. Don't let the team succumb to toil
and drudgery! Creating quality software requires passion!
