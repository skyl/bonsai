# Stay with One

Now that you've decided that some software absolutely must be built,
let's continue to keep it as minimal as possible. Zero is the best number.
The next best number is one. Don't have multiple ways to do things.
Don't maintain multiple copies of the same code. Don't have two databases.
Don't create multiple silos. Don't have different workflows for developers.
