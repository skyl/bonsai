# Delete What You Don't Need

You have everything in version control. Don't get sentimental about it.
Remove anything you don't need from the trunk version of the code. You're
staying close to the software so you have a lot of context and documentation.
Everything should be timestamped and linked to exact versions of code that
existed at that exact time. Delete it if it's no longer applicable to the
current version. Prune your Bonsai and weed your garden.
