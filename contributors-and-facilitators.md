# Contributors and Facilitators

Your software is your product; but, it's likely that not everyone
your team will be writing code.
Not all tasks can be completed by committing a change to your version
control.

Here we will define only two types of activities:

- Contributing change directly in version control
- Facilitating the engineering team

An individual might be purely a contributor or purely a facilitator.
Many people will do both types of activities.

## The Purpose of Facilitating

There are only two ways to help build your software product:
contributing and facilitating. The focus of facilitation it to:

- Collect the voice of the customer, understand the product vision
  and produce the perfect items for the engineers to start
  implementation, just-in-time as the engineers are ready for more work
- Protect the engineer while they implement, handle external communications
- Confirm that the changes work and are an improvement moving towards
  the project's goals

Pure facilitators can be the most important people on the team. Just because
someone is not writing code does not mean that they are not contributing
to the success of the software and the success of the team. But, emails
and meetings do not make software, only contributing changes can make software.
Therefore, any facilitation activities must be directed at eliminating
bottle necks at the phases before and after the core implementation
phase as well as protecting the engineering team from interruptions and
context switching during the implementation phase.
