# Find the Low-Hanging Fruit

One thing that facilitators and implementors can try to identify is
the "low-hanging" fruit or the best "bang for the buck" - changes that will
greatly improve the software but don't take much effort.

## Effort Estimation

Some teams use estimation techniques
like "planning poker" to give facilitators an idea of how hard different
features would be to implement. With this information,

My favorite estimation technique is the Uniform Kanban Ticket technique.
How many "tickets" would this take? Here a ticket should ideally take
"a couple of days" but maybe up to a week or two.

- Implement the API endpoint
- Create a new UI page with form
- Add option to backend, implement backend changes
- Write tutorial

"4" tickets, pessimistically 4-8 weeks of work. 2 people should easily
be able to do it in 4 weeks. Here there should be plenty of room for
discovery, errors, waste, context switching using a conservative estimate.
Perhaps the truth is that your best engineer could do it in a couple of days
of focused effort. It's better to over-deliver than over-promise.

If you consistently break down tickets so that they should be able to be
done in a "couple of days", you really don't have to make breakdown and
estimation any more complicated than that.
