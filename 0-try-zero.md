# Try Zero

Software can be expensive to produce and costly to maintain. The first step
to productivity in software development is to decide what not to build.
Turn back now. Don't build any software if you don't need to or are not
passionate about the software you want to build. Because you are reading this
text, we assume that you are going to go against this advice and build some
software. Still, build less, reduce the scope, don't build that feature,
say no. Don't create that new tool. Don't introduce that new dependency.
Don't create another repository. If it doesn't absolutely need to be done,
don't to it.

Zero is the best number.
