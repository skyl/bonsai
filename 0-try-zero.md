# Try Zero

Software can be expensive to produce and costly to maintain. The first step
to productivity in software development is to decide what not to build.
Turn back now. Don't build any software that you don't need.
Do not build software that you are not passionate about, if at all possible.
Because you are reading this text, we assume that you are disregarding
the admonition against building software and have decided to build some.
Still, build less, reduce the scope, don't build that feature,
say no. Don't create that new tool. Don't introduce that new dependency.
Don't add another step in the process.
Don't create another repository.
If it doesn't absolutely need to be done, don't to it.

Zero is the best number.
